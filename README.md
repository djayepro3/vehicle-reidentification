# Vehicle Re-Identification for Urban Mobility

The main idea is to re-identify vehicles at different checkpoints or camera points to monitor the flow of traffic.

Developed an image retrieval system using the VeRi dataset to re-identify vehicles to enhance urban mobility:
- Trained an embedding network with a pre-trained CNN and implemented triplet loss and mining strategy.
- Ranked test images by Euclidean distance in feature space and evaluated performance with mAP
